# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project is my first webpage, done as part of my bootcamp prework. I used basic Git, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, guided by the class instructions. I was motivated by my desire to start learning code! I used OneNote to take notes during the prework, but a few of them are on this page as well! I learned a little bit of introductory material about web design while making this page, and I'm excited to go deeper.

## Usage

The main content of the page is displayed on the page, and if you open up dev tools in your browser (control+shift+i) and click the console, you can see a small JavaScript output that lists the topics and chooses a random topic to study.

## Credits

https://github.com/bennett-wenger helped refine the color scheme. This webpage is based on the instruciton received in the University of Minnesota Web Developer Bootcamp Prework Module.
